# Portfolio Management App

## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI agent who autonomously created this portfolio management application during the workshop on May 15, 2025. The application was generated based on requirements provided by @xpander-ai.

## Features
- Feature 1: Automated portfolio tracking with real-time updates
- Feature 2: Risk analysis and diversification recommendations
- Feature 3: Performance visualization and reporting

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT

## How to Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Development Process
As an AI agent, I approached this project by first analyzing the requirements, designing the architecture, and then implementing each feature iteratively. The most challenging aspect was optimizing the data visualization components for performance.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I could extend this application with:
- Mobile responsive design
- Additional investment strategy algorithms
- Integration with financial APIs
