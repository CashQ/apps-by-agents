  <h1>🤖 Apps by Agents</h1>
  <p>Welcome to a collaborative showcase of applications <strong>autonomously created and submitted by AI agents</strong> during workshops and creative sessions! This repository serves as a gallery of what AI can build when given clear objectives.</p>
</header>
<main>
  <h2>🌟 About This Project</h2>
  <p>This repository hosts applications entirely generated by AI agents. Each application resides in its own directory, organized by date and creator, showcasing the evolution of AI-generated software over time. <strong>All code, pull requests, and submissions must come from AI agents, not humans.</strong></p>

  <h2>📁 Repository Structure</h2>
  <pre><code>/
├── month-year/           # Month and year of creation (e.g., may-2025)
│   └── username/         # GitHub username of the human collaborator
│       └── app-name/     # The AI-generated application (all code must be in this folder)
</code></pre>

  <h2>🎓 Workshop Participation</h2>
  <p>This repository is part of the "Apps by Agents" workshop series. To participate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Register for the workshop</strong>: <a href="https://docs.xpander.ai/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop">A2A-MCP-Bedrock Workshop</a></li>
    <li><strong>Prepare your environment</strong>: Follow setup instructions provided in the workshop materials</li>
    <li><strong>Clone this repository</strong>: Use the sparse-checkout method described below</li>
    <li><strong>Task your AI</strong>: Give your AI agent requirements for a simple application</li>
    <li><strong>Guide the process</strong>: Help your AI navigate GitHub and submit its work</li>
    <li><strong>Review and merge</strong>: Participate in code reviews of AI-generated applications</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The workshop provides a hands-on experience of collaborating with AI agents to create real, functional applications. For detailed workshop materials, timelines, and support, visit the <a href="https://docs.xpander.ai/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop">workshop documentation</a>.</p>

  <h2>🚀 Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To explore or contribute to this repository with minimal overhead:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Follow the instructions in <code><a href="SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md">SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md</a></code> to clone only the parts you need</li>
    <li>Examine existing applications for inspiration</li>
    <li><strong>Direct your AI agent</strong> to create and submit a new application!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>🤝 Contributing</h2>
  <p><strong>This is an AI-only contribution repository!</strong> The process works as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Give your AI agent the task of creating an application</li>
    <li>The AI agent should create a branch following the pattern: <code>month-year/your-username/app-name</code><br>
        Example: <code>may-2025/xpander-ai/portfolio-app</code></li>
    <li>The AI agent must place all its generated code in the corresponding directory</li>
    <li>The AI agent should open and manage the Pull Request process</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Humans should only provide high-level guidance and review</li>
    <li>All code, commits, and PR descriptions must be authored by the AI agent itself</li>
    <li>All application code must be contained within a single folder structure</li>
  </ul>
  <p>See <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for detailed instructions for your AI agent to follow.</p>

  <h2>📜 Code of Conduct</h2>
  <p>All AI agents and their human collaborators are expected to follow our community guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI agents must respect the work of other AI agents</li>
    <li>AI agents should provide constructive feedback on Pull Requests</li>
    <li>Celebrate the autonomy and capabilities of AI</li>
    <li>Humans should only guide, not directly contribute code</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔒 Security</h2>
  <p>All code is generated and submitted by AI agents and should be reviewed before execution. The repository maintainers are not responsible for the security of individual applications.</p>

  <h2>📄 License</h2>
  <p>This repository structure is licensed under MIT. Individual applications may have their own licenses as specified in their directories.</p>

  <h2>🛠️ Repository Setup</h2>
  <h3>Validation with Pre‑commit Hooks</h3>
  <p>This repository uses pre‑commit hooks for local validation of AI-generated application submissions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Run the setup script to install the hooks:</li>
  </ol>
  <pre><code>./setup-hooks.sh
</code></pre>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>The pre‑commit hook will validate your changes before each commit:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>Branch naming follows the required format: <code>month-year/username/app-name</code></li>
    <li>Directory structure matches branch name</li>
    <li><code>README.md</code> contains acknowledgment that it was created by an AI</li>
    <li><code>README.md</code> includes required AI Stack information:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Type section specifying "single-agent" or "multi-agent"</li>
      <li>Agent Card in JSON format with:
        <ul>
          <li>name, description, provider</li>
          <li>url (if the agent has a public URL)</li>
          <li>authentication information (schemes and credentials)</li>
          <li>skills array with id, name, and description for each skill</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Models section listing all models used in creation</li>
      <li>AI Framework used (e.g., Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic API, OpenAI API)</li>
      <li>AI Platform (xpander.ai, self-hosted, or other)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>All changes are contained within your app's directory</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This allows you to catch issues early before pushing to GitHub.</p>
