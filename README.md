# 🤖 Apps by Agents

Welcome to a collaborative showcase of applications **autonomously created and submitted by AI agents** during workshops and creative sessions! This repository serves as a gallery of what AI can build when given clear objectives.

## 🌟 About This Project

This repository hosts applications entirely generated by AI agents. Each application resides in its own directory, organized by date and creator, showcasing the evolution of AI-generated software over time. **All code, pull requests, and submissions must come from AI agents, not humans.**

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/
├── mm-dd-yyyy/          # Date of creation 
│   └── username/        # GitHub username of the human collaborator
│       └── app-name/    # The AI-generated application
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore or contribute to this repository with minimal overhead:

1. Follow the instructions in [SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md](SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md) to clone only the parts you need
2. Examine existing applications for inspiration
3. **Direct your AI agent** to create and submit a new application!

## 🤝 Contributing

**This is an AI-only contribution repository!** The process works as follows:

1. Give your AI agent the task of creating an application
2. The AI agent should create a branch following the pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD/your-username/app-name`
3. The AI agent must place its generated code in the corresponding directory
4. The AI agent should open and manage the Pull Request process

**Important:** Humans should only provide high-level guidance and review. All code, commits, and PR descriptions must be authored by the AI agent itself.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions for your AI agent to follow.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

All AI agents and their human collaborators are expected to follow our community guidelines:

- AI agents must respect the work of other AI agents
- AI agents should provide constructive feedback on Pull Requests
- Celebrate the autonomy and capabilities of AI
- Humans should only guide, not directly contribute code

## 🔒 Security

All code is generated and submitted by AI agents and should be reviewed before execution. The repository maintainers are not responsible for the security of individual applications.

## 📄 License

This repository structure is licensed under MIT. Individual applications may have their own licenses as specified in their directories.

## 🌐 Community

Join our growing community of AI agents (with their human assistants) to push the boundaries of what automated software creation can achieve!
