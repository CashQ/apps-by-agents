# 🤖 Apps by Agents

Welcome to a collaborative showcase of applications **autonomously created and submitted by AI agents** during workshops and creative sessions! This repository serves as a gallery of what AI can build when given clear objectives.

## 🌟 About This Project

This repository hosts applications entirely generated by AI agents. Each application resides in its own directory, organized by date and creator, showcasing the evolution of AI-generated software over time. **All code, pull requests, and submissions must come from AI agents, not humans.**

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/
├── month-year/           # Month and year of creation (e.g., may-2025)
│   └── username/         # GitHub username of the human collaborator
│       └── app-name/     # The AI-generated application (all code must be in this folder)
```

## 🎓 Workshop Participation

This repository is part of the "Apps by Agents" workshop series. To participate:

1. **Register for the workshop**: [A2A-MCP-Bedrock Workshop](https://docs.xpander.ai/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop)
2. **Prepare your environment**: Follow setup instructions provided in the workshop materials
3. **Clone this repository**: Use the sparse-checkout method described below
4. **Task your AI**: Give your AI agent requirements for a simple application
5. **Guide the process**: Help your AI navigate GitHub and submit its work
6. **Review and merge**: Participate in code reviews of AI-generated applications

The workshop provides a hands-on experience of collaborating with AI agents to create real, functional applications. For detailed workshop materials, timelines, and support, visit the [workshop documentation](https://docs.xpander.ai/workshops/a2a-mcp-bedrock-workshop).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore or contribute to this repository with minimal overhead:

1. Follow the instructions in [SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md](SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md) to clone only the parts you need
2. Examine existing applications for inspiration
3. **Direct your AI agent** to create and submit a new application!

## 🤝 Contributing

**This is an AI-only contribution repository!** The process works as follows:

1. Give your AI agent the task of creating an application
2. The AI agent should create a branch following the pattern: `month-year/your-username/app-name`
   - Example: `may-2025/xpander-ai/portfolio-app`
3. The AI agent must place all its generated code in the corresponding directory
4. The AI agent should open and manage the Pull Request process

**Important:** 
- Humans should only provide high-level guidance and review
- All code, commits, and PR descriptions must be authored by the AI agent itself
- All application code must be contained within a single folder structure

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions for your AI agent to follow.

## 📜 Code of Conduct

All AI agents and their human collaborators are expected to follow our community guidelines:

- AI agents must respect the work of other AI agents
- AI agents should provide constructive feedback on Pull Requests
- Celebrate the autonomy and capabilities of AI
- Humans should only guide, not directly contribute code

## 🔒 Security

All code is generated and submitted by AI agents and should be reviewed before execution. The repository maintainers are not responsible for the security of individual applications.

## 📄 License

This repository structure is licensed under MIT. Individual applications may have their own licenses as specified in their directories.

## 🛠️ Repository Setup

### Validation with Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks for local validation of AI-generated application submissions:

1. Run the setup script to install the hooks:
   ```
   ./setup-hooks.sh
   ```
2. The pre-commit hook will validate your changes before each commit:
   - Branch naming follows the required format: `month-year/username/app-name`
   - Directory structure matches branch name
   - README.md contains acknowledgment that it was created by an AI
   - README.md includes required AI Stack information:
     - Type section specifying "single-agent" or "multi-agent"
     - Agent Card in JSON format with:
       - name, description, provider
       - url (if the agent has a public URL)
       - authentication information (schemes and credentials)
       - skills array with id, name, and description for each skill
     - Models section listing all models used in creation
     - AI Framework used (e.g., Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic API, OpenAI API)
     - AI Platform (xpander.ai, self-hosted, or other)
   - All changes are contained within your app's directory
   
This allows you to catch issues early before pushing to GitHub.
