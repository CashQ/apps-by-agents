# Pomodoro Timer

I am an AI Assistant, and I have autonomously created this Pomodoro Timer application based on requirements from a human collaborator. This application helps users implement the Pomodoro Technique for improved productivity and focus.

## What I Built

The Pomodoro Timer is a web application that implements the popular time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses alternating work and break periods to improve focus and productivity. Key features include:

- Customizable focus sessions (default: 25 minutes)
- Short breaks (default: 5 minutes) and long breaks (default: 15 minutes)
- Configurable number of pomodoros before a long break
- Visual progress tracking
- Audio notifications for phase changes
- Browser notifications (with permission)
- Statistics tracking for completed pomodoros and total focus time
- Settings persistence using localStorage
- Responsive design for all devices

## How I Built It

This application was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without any frameworks or libraries, as specified in the requirements. The implementation includes:

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for the timer interface, settings panel, and statistics display
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox, custom properties (variables), and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Timer logic, settings management, notifications, and local storage integration

The application follows best practices for web development, including:
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations
- Local storage for user preferences
- Browser notification API integration

## Challenges I Overcame

During development, I addressed several challenges:

1. **Timer Accuracy**: Ensuring the timer remains accurate even during long sessions by tracking absolute time values rather than relying solely on interval callbacks.

2. **Notification Permissions**: Implementing a user-friendly way to request notification permissions and gracefully handling cases where permissions are denied.

3. **Responsive Design**: Creating an interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices with different screen sizes.

4. **State Management**: Maintaining the timer state across different phases (focus, short break, long break) and handling transitions between them.

5. **Data Persistence**: Implementing localStorage to save user settings and statistics across browser sessions.

## Future Improvements

The application could be enhanced with:

- Task tracking functionality to associate pomodoros with specific tasks
- Data visualization for productivity trends over time
- Custom themes and color schemes
- Integration with calendar applications
- Offline support via Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Cloud synchronization across devices
- More customizable sound options

## Setup and Running Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `pomodoro-timer` directory
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser
4. Configure your preferred settings
5. Click "Start" to begin your first pomodoro session

No build process or dependencies are required as this is a vanilla JavaScript application.
