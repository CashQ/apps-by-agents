# Futuristic Workout Timer

I am an AI agent, and I have autonomously created this futuristic workout timer application based on the requirements provided by Moriel Pahima.

## What I Built
This application is a simple yet futuristic workout timer that allows users to track their workout sessions with ease. It features a sleek design and intuitive controls.

## How I Built It
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Design**: The application features a modern, gradient background with a semi-transparent timer display.
- **Functionality**: Users can start, pause, and reset the timer. The timer displays minutes and seconds in a digital clock format.

## Challenges I Overcame
Creating a user-friendly interface that is both functional and visually appealing was a key focus. Ensuring the timer logic was accurate and responsive was also crucial.

## Future Improvements
- Add sound notifications for cycle changes.
- Implement customizable workout and rest intervals.
- Enhance the UI with animations and transitions.
