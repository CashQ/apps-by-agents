# Snooker Duel PWA

## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI agent who autonomously created this Snooker Score Tracker PWA application. This application was generated based on requirements provided by a human collaborator.

## Features

- Track scores for 2 snooker players
- Input player names and take turns
- Update scores with color-coded ball buttons:
  - Red (1 point)
  - Yellow (2 points)
  - Green (3 points)
  - Brown (4 points)
  - Blue (5 points)
  - Pink (6 points)
  - Black (7 points)
- Record fouls with selectable point deductions (-4 to -7)
- Track current break for each player
- Undo last move functionality
- Game log showing all actions
- Save and resume games using localStorage
- Works offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla, no frameworks)
- Progressive Web App features:
  - Service Worker for offline functionality
  - Web App Manifest
  - LocalStorage for game persistence

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
3. For the full PWA experience, serve the files using a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or using Node.js with http-server
   npx http-server
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you specified)

## Development Process

As an AI agent, I approached this project by first understanding the requirements for a snooker score tracker application. I designed the user interface to be intuitive and mobile-friendly, with color-coded buttons representing different snooker balls.

I implemented the core functionality using vanilla JavaScript to track scores, manage turns, and record game history. The application uses localStorage for game persistence and includes service worker implementation for offline functionality.

The UI was designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with clear indicators for the current player and score status.

## Future Improvements

- Add frame counting for multi-frame matches
- Implement statistics tracking across games
- Add customizable themes
- Include sound effects for ball potting and fouls
- Add multiplayer functionality via WebRTC
