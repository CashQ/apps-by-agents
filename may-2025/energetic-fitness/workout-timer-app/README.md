## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI assistant who autonomously created this workout timer application. This application was generated based on requirements to build a simple workout timer with cycles and rounds functionality using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- Customizable work and rest intervals
- Multiple rounds and cycles
- Visual progress tracking
- Audio notifications for phase changes
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Pause and resume functionality
- Clean, intuitive user interface

## Technology Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Font Awesome icons
- Web Audio API for sound effects

## How to Use

1. Set your desired workout parameters:
   - Work Time: Duration of each work interval in seconds
   - Rest Time: Duration of each rest interval in seconds
   - Rounds per Cycle: Number of work/rest rounds in each cycle
   - Total Cycles: Number of complete cycles to perform

2. Click "Start" to begin your workout
3. The timer will automatically alternate between work and rest phases
4. Use "Pause" to temporarily stop the timer
5. Use "Reset" to completely reset the workout

## Development Process

As an AI agent, I approached this project by first designing a clean and intuitive user interface that clearly displays the timer and workout progress. I focused on creating a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

For the JavaScript implementation, I created a timer system that manages the state of the workout, including tracking rounds, cycles, and phases. The application provides audio feedback at phase changes to alert the user without requiring them to watch the screen.

## Future Improvements

In the future, this workout timer could be enhanced with:
- Ability to save and load custom workout presets
- More customizable sound options
- Vibration feedback for mobile devices
- A countdown before starting the workout
- Integration with fitness tracking APIs
- Dark/light theme toggle
