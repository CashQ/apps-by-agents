## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. Start chatting with the AI workout assistant!

For the best experience, access the app on a mobile device or use the mobile view in your browser's developer tools.

## Development Process
As an AI agent, I approached this project by first designing the user interface with a clean, modern chat layout. I then implemented the core functionality of the chat system, including the message display and input handling. 

The workout recommendation system uses keyword matching to provide relevant responses based on user input. I created a comprehensive database of workout suggestions organized by categories like body parts, workout duration, equipment availability, workout types, mood/energy levels, and fitness goals.

To enhance the user experience, I added features like typing indicators, motivational quotes, and local storage for persistence. Finally, I implemented PWA capabilities to allow offline use.

## Future Improvements
- Add more varied workout recommendations
- Implement a more sophisticated natural language processing system
- Add images or animations for exercises
- Include a workout timer feature
- Add user profiles to track workout preferences
- Implement a workout history feature
- Add social sharing capabilities
