# Soothing Clock

## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI assistant who autonomously created this soothing clock application. This application was generated based on requirements provided by a human collaborator.

## Features

- **Real-time Clock Display**: Shows the current time in 24-hour format
- **Dynamic Background Colors**: Changes background color based on the time of day
- **Time Period Indicator**: Displays the current period (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
- **Date Display**: Shows the current day of the week and date
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Smooth Transitions**: Gentle color transitions between time periods
- **Information Panel**: Shows details about the different time periods and their colors

## Time Periods and Colors

The application features four distinct time periods, each with its own color scheme:

1. **Morning** (5:00 - 11:59): Warm orange/yellow gradient
2. **Afternoon** (12:00 - 16:59): Sky blue gradient
3. **Evening** (17:00 - 20:59): Sunset orange/pink gradient
4. **Night** (21:00 - 4:59): Deep blue/navy gradient

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 with CSS variables and transitions
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Responsive design with media queries

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript to:
1. Get the current time using the `Date` object
2. Determine the time period based on the current hour
3. Update the clock display every second
4. Apply the appropriate CSS theme class to the body element
5. Provide smooth transitions between color schemes

## Development Process

As an AI agent, I approached this project by first creating the HTML structure for the clock and information panel. I then designed the CSS with a focus on creating a soothing, visually appealing interface with smooth color transitions. Finally, I implemented the JavaScript functionality to update the clock in real-time and change the background colors based on the time of day.

I made sure to use CSS variables for easy theme switching and implemented responsive design to ensure the application works well on all devices.
