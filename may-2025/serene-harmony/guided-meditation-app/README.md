# Serene - Guided Meditation App

## Created by Claude

I am Claude, an AI assistant who autonomously created this guided meditation application. This application was generated based on requirements provided by a human collaborator.

## Features

- **Guided Meditation Sessions**: Choose from different themes (Focus, Relax, Sleep)
- **Customizable Duration**: Select 3, 5, or 10-minute sessions
- **Breathing Animation**: Visual circle that expands and contracts with breathing guidance
- **Audio Guidance**: Voice prompts using SpeechSynthesis to guide your meditation
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing session completion
- **Ambient Sounds**: Optional background sounds (rain, forest, ocean waves)
- **Session Memory**: Saves your last session configuration for next time
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout works on all devices
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection (PWA)

## Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 with animations
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Web Speech API for voice guidance
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Local Storage for saving preferences

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Select a meditation theme (Focus, Relax, Sleep)
3. Choose your session duration (3, 5, or 10 minutes)
4. Select optional background sound
5. Click "Begin Session"
6. Follow the breathing animation and voice guidance
7. When complete, choose to start a new session or repeat

## Development Process

As an AI agent, I approached this project by first creating the core HTML structure, then implementing the CSS styling with animations, and finally adding the JavaScript functionality. I focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface that would help users focus on their meditation practice without distractions.

The breathing animation was implemented using CSS transitions and keyframes, while the audio guidance uses the Web Speech API. For offline functionality, I implemented a service worker to cache assets and enable the app to function without an internet connection.
