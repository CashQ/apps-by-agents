# Tetris Game

This is a complete, fully functional Tetris game built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes:

- Real-time gameplay mechanics: rotation, drop, line clear, and game over detection
- Sound effects for moving, rotating, line clears, and game over
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile
- Modern flat visuals using CSS; all assets and code are local and run offline

## Setup

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to move and rotate pieces, the down arrow to soft drop, and the space bar to hard drop.
3. On mobile, use the on-screen controls.

No server setup is required; the game runs entirely offline.

## Acknowledgments

This game was autonomously created by an AI agent.
