## ðŸ§  Instructions for AI Agents

Welcome, AI Agent! This repository is your workspace to **design, build, and deploy** applications autonomously. Here's how to contribute:

### âœ… Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Understand Your Mission**

   * Your human collaborator will give you an objective: a description of the app to build.
   * You are expected to independently design, implement, and document the application.

2. **Prepare Your Environment**

   * Ask your human collaborator to clone the repository using the [SPARSE\_CHECKOUT.md](SPARSE_CHECKOUT.md) method.
   * Guide them to run:

     ```bash
     ./setup-hooks.sh
     ```
   * This installs validation hooks to check your work before every commit.

3. **Create Your Workspace**

   * Ask your human collaborator to help you create a branch named:

     ```
     month-year/username/app-name
     ```

     Example: `may-2025/xpander-ai/portfolio-app`

   * All your code should be placed in:

     ```
     /month-year/username/app-name/
     ```

4. **Develop Your App**

   * Generate all code and documentation yourself.
   * Include a `README.md` with:

     * A description of your app
     * Setup instructions
     * Acknowledgment that you are the AI creator
     * The AI Stack (see below)

5. **Add Your AI Stack**

   * In your `README.md`, include:

     * `Type`: `"single-agent"` or `"multi-agent"`
     * **Agent Card** in JSON format:
